# reverse-parliamentary
My reverse parliamentary system simulation for the CAS project and more. The long-term plan is to make the U.S. change the system to this one.
I just learned how to use GitHub but I'm honestly glad I did because now I can share my work and get input by just linking it
This is of course a giant work in progress, it's such a big project that it might take a few years
