# reverse-parliamentary
My reverse parliamentary system simulation for the CAS project and more. The long-term plan is to make the U.S. change the system to this one.
I just learned how to use GitHub but I'm honestly glad I did because now I can share my work and get input by just linking it
This is of course a giant work in progress, it's such a big project that it might take a few years

FIRST GENERATION OF PEOPLE
    these people will randomly choose a legislature between all 10 example parties
    then the code will calculate who won and have the people vote on the executive branch from the other side of the political spectrum.
    the code will finally print the parties who won each house.

SECOND GEN
    will vote like or against their parents 3/4 of the time, the other 1/4 will vote randomly. this will be determined by a boolean decision to see if the relationship with their parents was good or not.
    same things are printed out

THIRD GEN
    these people will have the same decision as second gen, but it will depend on whether their grandparents were bad too. if their grandparents were bad, then there is a 2/3 chance that their parents will have been bad too.
    then the boolean of whether they are voting the same or the opposite of their parents
    same things are printed out

LAWMAKING
    the legislative makes a law aligning with their ideals, left or right
    executive decides whether that law is close enough to their ideals, left or right
    if vetoed, legislative decides whether to override or not
    if the law has been vetoed and not overridden then legislative makes a new law, a little further from their own ideals
    if the law has been either not vetoed or vetoed and then overridden, it goes to the judicial branch, who have a similar system to that of the executive, except their side is absolute centrist
    if the law is constitutional, lawmaking ends
    if it is unconstitutional, legislative has to make a new law
